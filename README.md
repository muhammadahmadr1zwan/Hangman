# Hangman Game - Java Project

## Overview

This is a basic implementation of the classic word-guessing game "Hangman" developed in Java. The goal of the game is to guess a secret word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. For every wrong guess, a part of the hangman is drawn, and once the hangman is complete, the game ends in failure.

## Features

- Players can guess letters of a secret word.
- The game displays the current state of the word, showing correctly guessed letters and underscores for missing letters.
- A limited number of incorrect guesses is allowed before the game is lost.
- Supports both lowercase and uppercase letter inputs.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository** (or download the project files):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/hangman-java.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd hangman-java
   ```
3. **Compile the Java files**:
   ```bash
   javac Hangman.java
   ```
4. **Run the game**:
   ```bash
   java Hangman
   ```

## Game Rules

1. A random word is selected at the beginning of the game.
2. The player has to guess the letters one by one.
3. For each incorrect guess, the hangman drawing advances.
4. If the player guesses all letters correctly, they win.
5. If the hangman drawing is completed, the player loses.

## How to Play

1. Enter a letter to guess when prompted.
2. If the letter is correct, it will appear in its position(s) in the word.
3. If incorrect, the number of remaining attempts will decrease, and part of the hangman will be drawn.
4. Continue guessing until you either guess the word or run out of attempts.

## Example Gameplay

```
Secret word: _ _ _ _ _
Enter a letter: e
Correct! _ _ e _ _
Enter a letter: a
Incorrect! Remaining attempts: 5
...
```
